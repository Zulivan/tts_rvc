# TTS + RVC Project Archive

## Disclaimer

This repository is an archive of a deleted repository named "Okiba TTS RVC"
The original project was made by [litagin](https://github.com/litagin02).

### Project Overview

The TTS + RVC project involved the combination of Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology with Real-time Voice Cloning (RVC). The integration aimed to generate natural-sounding speech by cloning and reproducing a trained voice in real-time.

### Archiving for Persistence

To ensure the longevity and accessibility of the project, it has been archived here. Archiving helps in preserving the codebase and prevents it from being forgotten over time. It is also utilized in another project called [PyVidMaker](https://github.com/Zulivan/PyVidMaker). The functionalities developed in the original project contribute to the audio generation aspects of PyVidMaker.

The TTS + RVC project remains available for reference and potential future development.

Feel free to explore the code for insights into the TTS + RVC implementation.
